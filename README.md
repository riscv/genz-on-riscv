# Gen-Z on RISC-V Processor

Gen-Z is an open, scalable, memory semantic universal fabric interconnect which aims to unify and simplify communications among 
components. RISC-V processor is a free and open ISA intended to unlock processor innovation and increase processor solution and industry agility. Given the open nature of both these technologies, it makes good business sense to enable Gen-Z from the grounds up on a 
RISC-V processor based platform. The large address space of RISC-V, secured privileged execution environment and extensions 
possibilities with the ISA could lead to extensive collaboration with Gen-Z to build processor-integrated Gen-Z and fabric architectures that work together.

Refer to [High level arichtecure of RISC-V processor integrated Gen-Z solution](https://genzconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Accelerating-Innovation-Using-RISC-V-and-Gen-Z_V1.pdf).

This public repository is created for the further dicusssions and prove concept of RISC-V processor-integrated Gen-Z project.
